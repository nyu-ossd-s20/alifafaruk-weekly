title: Week 8 - Social Distancing 
---

This week was Spring Break, and the first offical week we were told the rest of the semester will be held remotely. Certain anxities and worries came with the idea of doing all my classes online. I took this week to familiarize and normalize the idea of doing online classes. I think this class, Open Source Software Development, will be faily the same remotely. A lot of our work is online. The class focuses on group work, and class-activites, rather than being too lecture dependent. Also, the class lectures are well designed and can be easily done online.

During the break, I did more research on our group project. My group is still deciding on what we want to do for our project contributions. We are ready to pick and get involved in the community. We are deciding on a project this week.
