### More Information

I am Alifa Faruk. I am currently a Junior at NYU studying Computer Science and minoring in Mathematics. I was born and raised in Queens. In my free time, I like exploring the city with friends and taking the time to learn something new. Aside from CS and math, another subject I am interested in is history.
