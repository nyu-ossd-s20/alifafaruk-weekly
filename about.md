I am Alifa Faruk, a junior studying Computer Science and Mathematics at NYU.

### More Information

I was born and raised in Queens, New York. Even though I grew up within the five boroughs, the city still fascinates me. In my free time, I like exploring the city with friends and taking the time to learn something new. Aside from CS and math, another subject I am interested in is history.
